Absolutely, here's a condensed version within the 350-word limit:

"This repository features a dynamic student registration webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering enhanced functionalities.

Key Features:

Student Information Collection: The form captures essential student details—first name, last name, email, age, gender, state, and major—to streamline registration and data gathering.
Candle Quantity Calculator: An integrated calculator empowers users to input the desired quantity of candles for purchase. Upon clicking "Calculate Total," the system instantly computes the total cost, factoring in a predetermined price per candle (e.g., $5).
Discount Incentive: To encourage larger orders, the system automatically applies a discount if the candle quantity exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., 10 candles). Surpassing this threshold triggers a percentage-based discount (e.g., 10%) deducted from the total cost, resulting in a reduced final amount.
This comprehensive webpage combines user-friendly data collection for student registration with a convenient calculator for candle purchases.
